# Ticket Worker

A skill for implementing the work described in a Jira-style markdown ticket (as produced by `ticket-maker` and planned by `ticket-planner`). It reads the ticket, understands the requirements, executes the implementation following the design, and completes the post-implementation sections of the ticket.

## When to Use This Skill

* User asks to "implement this ticket", "do the ticket", or "work on this ticket"
* User asks to "execute the plan" or "implement the design"
* User has a fully planned ticket open and wants the work carried out
* User says "build this feature" or "fix this bug" while referencing a ticket
* User asks to "complete the ticket" or "do the work described here"

## Prerequisites

* A work ticket in markdown format following the `ticket-maker` template
* The ticket must have the **Design** and **Estimate** sections filled in (typically by `ticket-planner`)
* Access to the codebase where the changes will be made
* The project should be in a buildable/testable state before starting

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Full Ticket

Parse the ticket markdown and extract all sections:

1. **Title** - what is being done
2. **Story** - who benefits, what they need, and why
3. **Description** - detailed context and background
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - the definition of done (the checklist to satisfy)
5. **Design** - the planned approach, key files, data/interfaces, edge cases, testing strategy
6. **Estimate** - expected effort level

The **Acceptance Criteria** are the primary measure of success. Every criterion must be met. The **Design** section is the roadmap - follow it unless there is a good reason to deviate.

### Step 2: Examine the Codebase

Before writing any code, gather context:

* Read the key files identified in the Design section
* Understand existing patterns, conventions, naming, error handling, and architecture
* Identify existing tests and test patterns to follow
* Check for related configuration, documentation, or schema files that may need updates

### Step 3: Implement the Changes

Work through the Design systematically:

1. **Follow the Design.** Implement changes in the order and manner described. If the Design identifies key files and approaches, follow them.
2. **Work incrementally.** Make changes file by file, verifying correctness as you go. Don't try to change everything at once.
3. **Follow existing patterns.** Match the codebase's coding style, naming conventions, error handling patterns, and architectural decisions.
4. **Handle edge cases.** Address the edge cases and risks called out in the Design section.
5. **Track deviations.** If you must deviate from the Design (e.g., discover a better approach, find the Design was based on incorrect assumptions, or encounter an obstacle), note the deviation and the reason.

#### Implementation Principles

* **Do the simplest thing that satisfies the acceptance criteria.** Don't over-engineer or add unrequested features.
* **Don't break existing functionality.** Be careful with refactors; ensure existing tests still pass.
* **Create clean, readable code.** Future developers will maintain this. Use clear names, add comments for non-obvious logic.
* **Respect scope boundaries.** If you discover work that should be done but is outside this ticket's scope, note it as a follow-up rather than doing it now.

### Step 4: Add or Update Tests

Following the testing strategy from the Design section:

* Add unit tests for new functionality
* Update existing tests if behavior has changed
* Follow the existing test patterns and frameworks in the codebase
* Ensure all tests pass - both new and existing

### Step 5: Update Documentation

If acceptance criteria or the Design section call for documentation updates:

* Update README files, inline documentation, or configuration schema descriptions
* Keep documentation consistent with the implemented behavior

### Step 6: Verify Against Acceptance Criteria

Go through every acceptance criterion one by one and verify it is met:

* [] Each specific criterion from the ticket - confirmed working
* [] Documentation updated (if the criterion was present)
* [] Unit tests added/updated (if the criterion was present)
* [] Project builds successfully
* [] All unit tests pass

If any criterion is not met, go back and address it before proceeding.

### Step 7: Fill In Post-Implementation Sections

Update the ticket markdown with the following sections. **Do not modify** the Title, Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Design, or Estimate sections.

#### Implementation Notes

Describe what was actually done:

* Summarize the changes made, file by file or feature by feature
* **Explicitly call out any deviations from the Design** - what changed, why, and what the actual approach was
* Note any surprises, difficulties, or decisions made during implementation
* If the work was straightforward and followed the Design exactly, say so briefly

#### Verification Notes

Provide clear guidance for a reviewer to verify the work:

* **How to test** - specific steps a reviewer can follow to verify the feature works (e.g., "Run the app, navigate to X, click Y, expect Z")
* **What to look for** - areas of risk or places where regressions are most likely
* **Test commands** - exact commands to run the test suite or specific test files
* **Edge cases to check** - any non-obvious scenarios the reviewer should verify
* **Configuration** - any settings, environment variables, or setup needed to test

#### Technical Release Notes

Write concise notes for a technical audience (developers, ops, architects):

* What was added, changed, or fixed
* Any new APIs, configuration keys, or interfaces introduced
* Breaking changes and migration steps (if any)
* Performance implications (if any)
* Dependencies added or updated (if any)

#### Customer Release Notes

Write concise notes for a non-technical audience (end users, product managers, stakeholders):

* What the user can now do that they couldn't before (or what bug was fixed)
* How it benefits them
* Any changes to existing workflow they should be aware of
* Avoid jargon - use plain language

### Step 8: Final Review

Before declaring the ticket complete:

1. Re-read the Acceptance Criteria one final time - every item should be satisfied
2. Ensure the project builds cleanly
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Ensure the four post-implementation sections are filled in
5. Confirm no unintended changes were made to files outside the ticket's scope

## Output Expectations

All ticket content written by this skill must follow the formatting rules defined in the
`/markdown-formatter` skill. In particular:

* Do not use em-dashes (`—`). Use a regular dash (`-`), comma, semicolon, or colon instead.
* Use `* []` for unchecked checkboxes and `* [x]` for checked checkboxes in Acceptance Criteria.

When the ticket is complete, the post-implementation sections should look like:

```markdown
## Implementation Notes

[Summary of what was done]

* **`path/to/file.ts`** - [what was changed]
* **`path/to/new-file.ts`** - [new file, purpose]
* ...

**Deviations from Design:** [None / description of deviations and reasons]

## Verification Notes

### How to Test

1. [Step-by-step verification instructions]
2. ...

### Test Commands

* `npm test` (or equivalent)
* `npm run build` (or equivalent)

### Areas of Risk

* [Specific areas a reviewer should scrutinize]

## Technical Release Notes

* [Concise technical description of changes]

## Customer Release Notes

* [Plain-language description of what changed for end users]
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Design section is empty or missing | Stop and ask the user to run `ticket-planner` first |
| Acceptance criteria are ambiguous | Interpret them in the most reasonable way; note your interpretation in Implementation Notes |
| Tests fail after changes | Debug and fix before proceeding; do not leave broken tests |
| Design approach doesn't work as expected | Deviate and document the deviation clearly in Implementation Notes |
| Scope creep discovered during implementation | Note it as a follow-up item in Implementation Notes; don't expand the ticket's scope |
| Build fails | Fix build errors before completing; they are part of the acceptance criteria |
