# Work Ticket Planner

A skill for analyzing Jira-style markdown work tickets (as produced by the `ticket-maker` skill) and filling in the **Estimate** and **Design** sections. It reads the ticket's intent, examines the relevant parts of the codebase, and produces a design outline and effort estimate that give a developer a clear starting point for implementation.

## When to Use This Skill

* User asks to "plan a ticket", "estimate a ticket", or "fill out the design"
* User has a work ticket markdown file open and wants the Design and Estimate completed
* User asks to "analyze this ticket" or "figure out how to implement this"
* User wants a development approach and effort estimate for a piece of work
* User says "plan implementation" or "what would it take to do this ticket"

## Prerequisites

* A work ticket in markdown format following the `ticket-maker` template (must have Title, Story, Description, and Acceptance Criteria sections)
* Access to the relevant codebase so the skill can examine existing code, architecture, and patterns

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Ticket

Parse the ticket markdown and extract:

1. **Title** - the concise summary of the work
2. **Story** - the user role, desired capability, and motivation
3. **Description** - the detailed problem context, examples, and workflows
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - the specific conditions that define "done"

Synthesize these into a clear understanding of **what** needs to be built or changed and **why**.

### Step 2: Examine the Codebase

Using the ticket's intent as a guide, search the codebase to understand:

* **Where** the change will land - which files, modules, layers, or services are involved
* **What exists** - current implementations, patterns, conventions, and data structures relevant to the ticket
* **What's adjacent** - related features, shared utilities, or abstractions that can be reused or must be respected
* **What's affected** - downstream consumers, tests, documentation, or configuration that may need updates

Focus the investigation on building enough context to describe a credible approach. Do not attempt to read the entire codebase - target the areas the ticket touches.

### Step 3: Determine the Estimate

Assign an estimate using the standard scale:

| Estimate | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | Trivial - minutes of effort, a one-line change or config tweak |
| 2        | Small - under half a day, a few files touched |
| 3        | Moderate - roughly half a day, some thought required |
| 5        | Significant - about a day, multiple files or a new minor feature |
| 8        | Large - a few days, cross-cutting changes or a substantial feature |
| 10       | Very large - up to a week, significant new functionality or refactor |
| 20       | Too large - recommend breaking into smaller tickets |

Consider:

* Number of files/modules that need changes
* Whether new abstractions, APIs, or data structures are needed
* Testing complexity (new test infrastructure vs. adding cases to existing suites)
* Risk of regressions or breaking changes
* Whether the work is routine (following existing patterns) or novel

If the estimate is **20**, explicitly recommend how to split the ticket.

### Step 4: Write the Design Section

Fill in the **Design** section of the ticket with a clear, concise plan. The design should give a developer enough direction to begin implementation without ambiguity about the general approach. It need not be a line-by-line implementation plan, but it must answer:

1. **Approach** - What is the high-level strategy? (e.g., "Add a new service class that…", "Extend the existing handler to…", "Refactor X into Y so that…")
2. **Key files / modules** - Which specific files or areas of the codebase will be created or modified?
3. **Data & interfaces** - Are there new types, interfaces, APIs, or schema changes? Briefly describe them.
4. **Behavioral changes** - How will the system behave differently after this work? Any new user-facing flows?
5. **Edge cases & risks** - Are there known edge cases, backward-compatibility concerns, or risks to call out?
6. **Testing strategy** - What kinds of tests are needed? (unit, integration, manual verification) Which existing test patterns to follow?
7. **Documentation** - What documentation needs updating? (README, inline docs, config schema descriptions, user facing documentation, AI facing documentation, etc.)

#### Design Writing Guidelines

* **Be concrete.** Name files, functions, types, and config keys where known. Reference what you found in the codebase.
* **Be proportional.** A trivial ticket (estimate 1–2) needs only a sentence or two. A large ticket (estimate 8–10) warrants a more detailed breakdown.
* **Follow existing patterns.** If the codebase has established conventions (naming, architecture, error handling), note that the implementation should follow them.
* **Flag unknowns.** If something needs further investigation or a decision from the team, call it out explicitly rather than guessing.
* **Use lists and short paragraphs.** The design should be scannable, not a wall of text.

### Step 5: Update the Ticket

Replace the placeholder text in the **Estimate** and **Design** sections of the ticket markdown with the completed content. Do not modify any other sections.

## Output Format

All ticket content written by this skill must follow the formatting rules defined in the
`/markdown-formatter` skill. In particular:

* Do not use em-dashes (`—`). Use a regular dash (`-`), comma, semicolon, or colon instead.
* Use `* []` for unchecked checkboxes and `* [x]` for checked checkboxes in Acceptance Criteria.

When updating the ticket, the Design section should look like:

```markdown
## Design

### Approach

[1–3 sentences describing the high-level strategy]

### Key Changes

* **`path/to/file.ts`** - [what changes and why]
* **`path/to/other.ts`** - [what changes and why]
* [New file] **`path/to/new.ts`** - [purpose]

### Data & Interfaces

* [New type/interface/schema description, if any]

### Edge Cases & Risks

* [Known risks, backward-compatibility notes, or decisions needed]

### Testing

* [What to test and how, following existing patterns]

### Documentation

* [What docs to update]
```

And the Estimate section:

```markdown
**Estimate:** **[N]** - [one-sentence justification]
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Ticket has no clear acceptance criteria | Ask the user to complete the acceptance criteria before planning |
| Codebase is too large to understand quickly | Focus on the modules/files mentioned or implied by the ticket; use grep and file search to narrow scope |
| Estimate is 20 | Recommend splitting; suggest 2–4 sub-tickets with rough scope for each |
| Design feels too speculative | Flag unknowns explicitly; a design with called-out unknowns is better than a falsely confident one |
| Ticket is a bug fix | Look for the likely source of the bug first; design should describe the fix and how to verify it |
