# Markdown Formatting Rules

## Mission

Keep markdown formatting consistent across all JerryCAN documentation and instructions files
and aligned with formatting rules.

## Formatting Rules

Markdown must conform to the following `markdownlint` rule set:

```json
{
    "default": false,
    "MD001": true,
    "MD002": false,
    "MD003": { "style": "atx" },
    "MD004": { "style": "asterisk" },
    "MD005": true,
    "MD006": false,
    "MD007": { "indent": 4, "start_indented": false },
    "MD009": { "br_spaces": 0, "list_item_empty_lines": false, "strict": true },
    "MD010": { "code_blocks": false },
    "MD011": true,
    "MD012": { "maximum": 1 },
    "MD013": { "line_length": 120, "heading_line_length": 120, "code_block_line_length": 120, "code_blocks": false, "tables": false },
    "MD014": true,
    "MD018": true,
    "MD019": true,
    "MD020": false,
    "MD021": false,
    "MD022": { "lines_above": 1, "lines_below": 0 },
    "MD023": true,
    "MD024": { "allow_different_nesting": false, "siblings_only": false },
    "MD025": { "level": 1, "front_matter_title": ""},
    "MD026": { "punctuation": ".,;:!?。，；：！？" },
    "MD027": true,
    "MD028": true,
    "MD029": { "style": "ordered" },
    "MD030": { "ul_single": 1, "ol_single": 1, "ul_multi": 1, "ol_multi": 1 },
    "MD031": { "list_items": true },
    "MD032": true,
    "MD033": { "allowed_elements": ["br"] },
    "MD034": true,
    "MD035": { "style": "---" },
    "MD036": { "punctuation": ".,;:!?。，；：！？" },
    "MD037": true,
    "MD038": true,
    "MD039": true,
    "MD040": true,
    "MD041": { "level": 1, "front_matter_title": "" },
    "MD042": true,
    "MD043": false,
    "MD044": false,
    "MD045": true,
    "MD046": { "style": "fenced" },
    "MD047": true,
    "MD048": { "style": "backtick" }
}
```

## Plain-English Summary

The JSON above is the source of truth. In practical terms, it means:

* Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) and keep heading levels ordered (MD001, MD003).
* Keep one H1 per file (MD025).
* Do not use duplicate heading text within the same file (MD024). Every heading
  must be unique regardless of nesting level.
* Do not end headings with punctuation such as `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, or `?` (MD026).
* Use `*` for unordered list items (MD004).
* Use fenced code blocks with backticks and always include a language/info string (MD040, MD046, MD048).
* Leave a single blank line where needed around lists, headings, and code fences (MD022, MD031, MD032).
* Do not leave trailing spaces or multiple consecutive blank lines (MD009, MD012).
* Avoid bare URLs; use proper markdown links (MD034).
* Avoid raw HTML except `<br>` (MD033).
* Avoid the use of the emdash `—` character; prefer usage of a `-`, comma, semicolon, or colon
  instead (as best fits the sentence flow and context).
* Consecutive blockquote lines must not be separated by a bare blank line. Use an
  empty blockquote continuation (`>`) to maintain a single blockquote block (MD028).

    ```markdown
    <!-- WRONG -->
    > NOTE: First quoted block

    > WARNING: Second quoted block

    <!-- RIGHT -->
    > NOTE: First quoted block
    >
    > WARNING: Second quoted block
    ```

## Line Length

Lines must not exceed 120 characters (MD013). This applies to all prose, headings,
and inline code. Code blocks and tables are exempt.

When wrapping is needed, maintain the formatting context of the current block:

* **List items**: Indent continuation lines to align with the first word of the
  list item text (i.e., 2 spaces for `*`, 3 for `1.`, 4 for sub-items, etc.).

    ```markdown
    * This is a long list item that needs to wrap to a second line
      because it exceeds the 120-character limit.
    ```

* **Blockquote callouts**: Repeat the `>` prefix on each continuation line:

    ```markdown
    > ⚠️ This is a warning that is long enough to require wrapping
    > across two lines in the source markdown.
    ```

* **Nested blockquotes in lists**: Combine the list indentation with `>`:

    ```markdown
    1. First step.

        > ℹ️ Additional context for step 1 that wraps to a
        > second line.

    2. Second step.
    ```

* **Prose paragraphs**: Simply break at a natural word boundary before
  column 120. No special prefix is needed.

## Callout Blocks

Use blockquote-style callouts for inline warnings, notes, and informational asides.
Each callout is a single `>` blockquote whose first token is an emoji indicator:

| Type | Icon | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| Alert | 🟥 | Unignorable facts or instructions that MUST be obeyed that may result in catastrophic outcomes if ignored (loss of data, destruction of property, loss of life) |
| Warning | ⚠️ | Gotchas, destructive actions, or performance/security caveats |
| Tip | 💡 | Helpful suggestions, shortcuts, or recommended starting points |
| Note | 📓 | Conventions, reminders, or things the reader should keep in mind |
| Info | ℹ️ | Background context, references to standards, or supplementary detail |
| Success | ✅ | Confirmation of completion, positive outcomes, or readiness indicators |

### Examples

```markdown
> 🟥 Do NOT use this software to operate a nuclear reactor.

> ⚠️ Specifying a high accuracy threshold may negatively impact performance

> � Start with the Concepts page if you've never done sensor simulation before.

> 📓 Australian English spelling is preferred.

> ℹ️ This is based on ISO standard ABC-1234

> ✅ All tests pass. You're ready to deploy.
```

### Rules

* Place the emoji immediately after `>` followed by a single space, then the text.
* Keep callouts to one or two sentences. For longer content, use a regular subsection instead.
* Do not nest callouts inside other blockquotes or list items.
* Do not use GitHub-flavoured `[!NOTE]` / `[!WARNING]` admonition syntax; the emoji
  blockquote style is the standard for this repository.
* Do not use MkDocs `!!! type "title"` admonition syntax; use the emoji blockquote
  style instead.

## Diagrams

Use Mermaid diagrams (refer to <https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html> for syntax)
for...

* Flowcharts
* Sequence Diagrams
* Class Diagrams
* State Diagrams
* Entity Relationship Diagrams
* User Journey Charts
* Gantt CHarts
* Pie Charts
* Quadrant Charts
* Requirement Diagrams
* GitGraph (Git) Diagrams
* C4 Diagrams

* Timelines
* ZenUML Diagrams
* Sankey Chart
* XY Charts
* Block Diagrams
* Packet
* Kanban
* Architecture
* Radar
* Treemap
* Venn
* Ishikawa
* TreeView

ASCII Art diagrams may also be used.

## Formulae

While simple add, subtract, divide, and multiply operations may be represented with plaint text,
consideration should given to formatting them using Latex mathematical expression syntax, such as
inline syntax such as $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, or multiline syntax, such as:

$$
a = \max\left(\frac{F_{\mathrm{net}}}{m \cdot (1 + k_{\mathrm{rot}})}, 0\right)
$$

## Link Correctness

All markdown links must be validated for correctness. This applies to both
inline links (`[text](target)`) and reference-style links (`[text][ref]`).

### Internal Links

Internal links point to other files or headings within the repository.

* **Relative file paths**: Every relative link target (e.g.,
  `[foo](../bar/baz.md)`) must resolve to a file that actually exists on
  disk when evaluated from the directory containing the source file. Use
  tools such as `file_search` or `list_dir` to confirm the target exists
  before accepting a link as valid.
* **Anchor fragments**: If a link includes a fragment (e.g.,
  `[section](./page.md#some-heading)`), verify that the target file
  contains a heading whose auto-generated slug matches the fragment. Slug
  rules: lowercase, spaces become hyphens, non-alphanumeric characters
  (except hyphens) are removed.
* **No dead links after refactoring**: When files are moved, renamed, or
  deleted, search the entire `docs/` tree (and any other `.md` files in
  the repo) for links that referenced the old path and update or remove
  them.
* **Case sensitivity**: Treat file paths as case-sensitive (Linux
  filesystem). `Foo.md` and `foo.md` are different files.

### External Links

External links point to URLs outside the repository (HTTP/HTTPS).

* **Well-formed URLs**: Every external link must be a syntactically valid
  URL with an `http://` or `https://` scheme.
* **No placeholder URLs**: Links must not contain placeholder or example
  domains (e.g., `example.com`, `TODO`, `TBD`).
* **Stable references preferred**: Prefer permalinks or versioned URLs
  over links that are likely to rot (e.g., link to a tagged release
  rather than `master`/`main` when referencing a specific code snapshot).

### Validation Procedure

When reviewing or editing markdown files, perform the following checks:

1. Extract every link target from the file.
2. For each internal link, confirm the target file exists and any anchor
   fragment matches a heading in that file.
3. For each external link, confirm the URL is well-formed and does not
   use a placeholder domain.
4. Report or fix any broken links before considering the file complete.
